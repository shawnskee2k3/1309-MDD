I setup the Github file by simply creating a githud account and then verifying it thru e-mail. 
Then I just needed to create a repository and test.

9/17/13 - Added images and completed recipes of the day modal and buttons
          still working on getting search to work, getting a api error when 
          search
          
9/26/13 - Made a little progress with the search bar but not enough to finish, added footer to design
          changed some file structure to try and fix the search bar, Still not working. Pressing the search 
          button returns the api from Yummly but not what is entered into the field.
